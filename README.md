# CRUD REST API using Node, Express & MongoDB.

## Using POSTMAN you can test your REST API (or you can create VIEWS). [Click here...](https://www.postman.com/)

 * Postman is a great tool when trying to dissect RESTful APIs made by others or test ones you have made yourself. It offers a sleek user interface with which to make HTML requests, without the hassle of writing a bunch of code just to test an API's functionality. 

## Creating a REST API with the following access rights:

**GET**:- *Reading / Getting* 

**POST**:- *Creating / Sending*

**PATCH**:- *Minor Updates*

**DELETE**:- *Deleting*

## MongoDB is the database for storing data purposes.

## Express is the web framework used.

### Dependencies (packages) installed using the VS terminal 
**( using the VS terminal is easier cuz its already directed to the project folder )**

    "npm init" (used to create the JSON packages)
    "npm i express"
    "npm i mongodb"
    "npm i mongoose"
    "npm i nodemon --save-dev"

### Make sure that your mongodb server is running in the background, open a new external terminal (cmd not hte VS terminal) enter:

    mongod

### MVC Architecture

**M - Model - Schema**

**V - View - UI**

**C - Controller - Router**
